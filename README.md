These Java-based Fr8 Terminals work with the [Fr8 ecosystem](http://www.fr8.co). Fr8 is an open source cloud based integration platform ([iPaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_integration)).

Fr8 Terminals communicate with Fr8 Hubs using RESTful endpoints, Http, and JSON. The SDK portion of this repository provides tools to make it easier for Terminals to be created and to keep things DRY. For example, there are object mapper classes that allow Java developers to avoid having to personally deal with the serialization and deserialization of POJO into JSON.

Fr8 Core is written in .NET. The Java SDK maps enough of the core to get integrated into Fr8. (Since [.NET SDK](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/ForDevelopers/SDK/.NET/Home.md) is more mature, you may want to look at it to get a sense of the roadmap.)

Currently, this repository contains a single Terminal, the Fr8 Github Terminal. This Terminal exposes useful Github services to Fr8 Plans via a set of activities like Get Issue.

## Developing a Fr8 Terminal


1) You only need to clone this repo if you want to build or modify Fr8 Terminals written in Java. Before doing so, make sure you're familiar with Fr8 as an end user by building Fr8 Plans at the [main Fr8 website](http://fr8.co).

1) Read the [development guides](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/ForDevelopers/DevGuideHome.md), especially the [Terminal Development Guide](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/ForDevelopers/DevelopmentGuides/TerminalDevelopmentGuide.md).

1) Clone this repo. You'll want to be familiar with the  [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com).

1) Choose a [development approach](https://github.com/Fr8org/Fr8Core/blob/master/Docs/ForDevelopers/DevelopmentGuides/ChoosingADevelopmentApproach.md).  The Fr8 service at fr8.co uses Heroku to deploy production and dev Java Terminals.

1) Setup your dev environment. These environment variables are needed. (Heroku example shown)

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| CORE_WEBSERVER_URL: | http://dev.fr8.co |
| TERMINAL_HOST: | http://fr8java.herokuapp.com |
